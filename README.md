# Add Hand Slot Simplified for Card Survival

This is the "simplified" version of PikachuPiPiPi's ["Add Hand Slot"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cardsurvivaltropicalisland/mods/94) mod on Nexus Mods.

The name of the mod was retained; however, the purpose of the mod is to show more cards on the screen at a time.  The mod shrinks the card size and shows multiple lines per row.

My guess is that the origiinal mod's purpose was to extend the hand size, and then the view was added on later.

# Changes

This simplified version of the mod has the following changes:

* Removes Mod Loader reference/need
* Removes the ability to change the hand size.  (Required by Mod Loader).
