# Add Hand Slot Simplified for Card Survival

This is a "simplified" fork of PikachuPiPiPi's ["Add Hand Slot"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cardsurvivaltropicalisland/mods/94) mod on Nexus Mods.

The purpose of the mod is to show more cards on the screen at a time.  The mod shrinks the card size and shows multiple lines per row.

This forked version of "Add Hand Slot" strips all functionality except the view functionality.  This change removes the dependency on ModLoader.

# Changes

* Removes Mod Loader reference/need
* Removes the ability to change the hand size.  (Required by Mod Loader).
